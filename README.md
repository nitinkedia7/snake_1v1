## Rules
Obviously the rules of a normal snake game apply, additional coplayer rules follow:

- A snake dies if it's head touches any other part of itself or any part of another snake.
- Points are displayed in console.

## Build With:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## Additional notes:
The js engine actually supports any number of snakes and foods.
By default it is set to Coplayer for less congestion in keyboard while playing. Improvements and comments are welcome.
